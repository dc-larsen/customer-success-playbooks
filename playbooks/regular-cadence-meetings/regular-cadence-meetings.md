# Regular Cadence Meetings

**How to run check-ins that add value, surface risk, and build real trust**

Regular cadence calls are not calendar filler. Done well, they compound customer value and make risk obvious early. Done poorly, they're just status updates everyone forgets.

---

## 1. Start with the meeting type and goal

Before you join the call, be explicit about why it exists.

**Common meeting types:**
- Onboarding check-in
- Ongoing cadence / monthly sync
- Expansion or growth discussion
- Product update + feedback
- Quarterly or semi-annual health check

Each meeting type has a different goal. If you don't know the goal, the customer won't either.

**Reality check:** If you can't articulate the purpose of the call in one sentence, reschedule it.

---

## 2. Two objectives of a regular cadence call

For a standard recurring check-in, your job is simple:

1. **Add value**
2. **Assess account risk**

Everything else is in service of those two outcomes.

Not an interrogation. Not a feature dump. A good conversation naturally reveals risk when you ask the right questions.

---

## 3. How to add value (the consultative way)

Value does not come from slides. It comes from preparation.

**Before the call:**
- Log into the customer's instance
- Review logins and engagement
- Check feature adoption
- Look at integrations connected (or missing)
- Identify clear gaps in usage (for example: a missing integration, a feature adopted by one user but not the team, or usage plateauing after onboarding)

**Then:**
- Bring 1-2 specific recommendations
- Tie each recommendation back to why they bought

**Example:**
> "You originally bought to reduce X. I noticed you haven't adopted Y yet, which directly supports that goal."

That's the difference between pushing features and being consultative.

## 4. How to assess risk without making it awkward

Risk assessment happens in two lanes.

### A. Adoption-based risk

Ask yourself and the customer:
- Are they using the features required to be successful?
- Are they solving the problems they originally bought us for?
- Has their use case changed?

### B. Sentiment-based risk (the vibe check)

Ask direct but human questions:
- "If your renewal were today, how would you feel about it?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how well are we meeting the reason you bought?"
- "What would make this a 10?"

The number doesn't matter. The explanation does.

## 5. Mechanics that build trust

Small things, done consistently, matter.

**Record the call and use AI notes**
- Stay present. Don't manually take notes.
- Use Gong or an equivalent tool. The point is to stay present and let AI handle capture. I personally prefer Granola.

**Send a post-call follow-up**
- Slack or email is fine
- Include: notes, docs shared, feature requests logged, bugs created, clear next steps

**Hard truth:** If there's nothing to follow up on, question whether the meeting added value.

---

## 6. Always leave the customer with homework

Customers should leave every call with a clear action.

**Examples:**
- Integrate a missing tool
- Onboard a new team
- Try a specific feature
- Review a document or proposal

Your job is not to click the buttons for them. Your job is to:
- Assign the action
- Check back on it
- Hold the line

If it doesn't happen, talk about why on the next call.

Progress doesn't happen passively.

---

## 7. Coach yourself deliberately

Listen to at least one of your own calls per month.

**Focus on:**
- How you explain the product
- How often you talk vs listen
- How directly you address risk
- Where you ramble or hedge

Pick 1-2 things to improve and carry them into the next call.

If you're in a larger org, your manager is already reviewing calls. Get ahead of it.

---

## 8. Basic professionalism still matters

These are obvious, but still missed:
- Camera on
- Wear something respectable
- Learn who the person is, not just their role

Customer Success is a long-term relationship business. Make it human. It's more fun that way.

---

## 9. Upload notes to your CRM

Do this every time.
- It creates visibility
- It makes you look buttoned up
- Most people still don't do it

That alone will differentiate you internally.

---

## 10. Update risk immediately after meaningful calls

If a call changed how you feel about the account:
- Update the risk score
- Update the risk notes
- Do it while it's fresh

Risk is not a passive field. It should trigger action and attention.

If risk doesn't feel loud, your system is broken.

---

## Final thought

Great cadence calls are not about frequency. They're about intention, preparation, and follow-through.

Do those three things well and:
- Value becomes obvious
- Risk surfaces early
- Renewals stop being surprises

If this resonates, steal it. Or send it to the CSM who keeps running status calls.
