# Regular Cadence Meetings

## 🎯 Know Your Meeting Type

Understand the reason you have this call. Are you:
- Onboarding a new customer
- Working on an expansion
- Checking in to communicate product improvements and assess risk
- Running a quarterly health check

There are many meeting types in customer success. Know what you're walking into and what the goal is.

## 📋 Two Goals for Regular Check-Ins

For standard cadence calls, you want to do two things:

1. **Add value**
2. **Assess account risk**

Come with something valuable to share. Then assess risk through natural conversation and the right questions.

## 💡 Adding Value

I do two things before every call:

**1. Review their instance**
- Check logins, integrations, product usage (or non-usage)
- Come prepared to recommend something: a new feature, something they never adopted during onboarding

**2. Pair recommendations with their purchase reason**
- Connect your recommendation to the problem they're trying to solve
- This is consultative selling, not feature pushing

## ⚠️ Assessing Risk

I ask questions in two areas:

**1. Adoption check**
- Has the customer adopted the features that will make them successful?
- Are they using the product in ways that align with their use case and the problems they bought it to solve?

**2. Vibe check**
- "If you had to renew today, would you?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how closely are we meeting the reason you bought?"
- Dig into the answer. If they say 8/10, ask what would make it a 10.

## 🔧 Call Mechanics

Nail these and you'll build trust and rapport:

- **Record and take AI notes.** Use Gong, Granola, or whatever works. Don't manually take notes. Stay present in the conversation.
- **Send a follow-up after the call.** Slack or email. Most of the time you should have docs to send, feature requests to log, bugs to create. If not, question the success of the meeting.

## 📝 Give Customers Homework

Customers should leave every call with an action to take:
- Integrate X
- Onboard new team Y
- Configure Z

Whatever it is, they need a clear next step to improve the value they're getting. Give them homework, check in on it, hold them accountable. You can't click the buttons for them.

## 🎧 Coach Yourself

Listen to at least one of your calls per month.
- Notice how you talk about the product, about the company
- Listening to yourself is painful at first, but you'll get better

If you're at a large enterprise company, your manager is likely reviewing your Gong calls each week. Get ahead of them. Identify 1-2 things you want to improve and keep them top of mind going into your next calls.

## 🤝 Small Tactical Things

These might be obvious, but:
- Always keep your camera on
- Wear something respectable
- Spend time getting to know the person you're working with (it's more fun that way, and it's a long-term relationship)

## 📊 After the Call

**Upload your call notes to your CRM.** It will make you look good. Not everyone does this.

**Update the risk score or risk fields.** This is one of the major parts of your job. Risk should make you go off like an alarm.
