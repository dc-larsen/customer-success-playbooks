# Case Studies

**How to identify, capture, and publish customer success stories**

Case studies are proof. They show prospects that your product works for companies like theirs. But most CS teams let them slip through the cracks because there's no system to capture them.

This playbook covers when to pursue a case study, how to execute it, and how to build a system that ensures they actually get done.

## 1. Case study readiness criteria

Before pursuing any case study, verify:

- **Mutual Success Plan milestones have been met**
- **Measurable KPI improvement has occurred** (e.g., performance, productivity, security posture)
- **Positive sentiment is expressed by the customer** (NPS ≥ 8, unsolicited praise, or confirmed renewal)
- **The product is demonstrably solving the customer's core problem** — if no real problem is solved, no case study should be pursued
- **Avoid customers with MSA restrictions** that block public logo/name use, unless doing an anonymized industry-focused case study (e.g., "a major airline")

---

## 2. Internal alignment before asking

Complete these steps before approaching the customer:

- **CSM and marketing agree on the narrative angle** (technical win, ROI, speed of deployment, competitive replacement, etc.)
- **Loop in sales** if there is expansion or renewal influence
- **Confirm with legal** that there are no contractual blockers

---

## 3. Customer approval path

Map the approval process:

- **Identify the approvals needed at the customer** (marketing, legal, executive sponsor)
- **Map out the process** so the internal champion knows what's required before committing

---

## 4. Data collection

Gather proof points:

- **Capture baseline metrics from onboarding** ("before" picture)
- **Capture current metrics showing impact**
- **Document real stories/examples of problems solved**
- **Collect strong customer quotes from past calls** that could be used

---

## 5. Incentives and value for the champion

Make it worth their time:

- **Professional recognition** — name, title, and photo featured on your site or social channels
- **Give them a polished PDF** they can share internally and on LinkedIn
- **Share metrics post-publication** ("Your story's been read X times") to reinforce their impact
- **Offer optional incentives:** small gifts, gift cards, early access to beta features, or co-marketing exposure
- **Tie the case study's success to the champion's personal KPIs** to position them as a leader internally

---

## 6. Execution process

Follow this workflow:

1. **CSM builds trust and gets verbal commitment** from the champion
2. **Marketing acts as the "reporter,"** interviewing the champion and drafting the story
3. **CSM supports the process** by providing data, customer context, and ensuring accuracy in the story

---

## 7. Post-publication follow-up

Complete the loop:

- **Share the final case study with the champion** in multiple formats (PDF, link)
- **Recognize the customer publicly** (social media, internal comms)
- **Reference the win in future QBRs and cadence calls**
- **Track performance of the case study** and share updates with the champion

---

## 8. Scaling case studies (so they actually happen)

Case studies fall apart when they depend on CSMs remembering to ask. You need systems that surface candidates automatically and track progress until publication.

### Capture commitment during the deal

Add a "case study commitment" field to your deal object in your CRM. Sales asks during negotiation. Options:
- Accepted
- Declined
- Not discussed

This creates a list of customers who already said yes before they even onboarded.

### Automate candidate creation

When a deal closes with an accepted case study commitment:
- Automatically create a case study record linked to the account
- Assign it to the CSM
- Set initial status to "Not Started"
- Include deal context (close date, use case, champion)

This can run daily via workflow automation (n8n, Zapier, native CRM automation). No manual entry, no forgetting.

### Track status in your CRM

Create a case study custom object with stages:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| Not Started | Commitment exists, CSM hasn't begun |
| In Progress | CSM is collecting data or coordinating with marketing |
| Awaiting Customer Approval | Draft sent, waiting on sign-off |
| Published | Live on website |
| On Hold | Timing issue, revisit later |
| Declined | Customer backed out |

This gives leadership visibility into the pipeline and prevents case studies from getting lost.

### Notify the team

When new case study records are created, post to a shared Slack channel:
- Customer name
- CSM assigned
- Link to the record

This creates accountability and lets marketing see what's coming.

### Review regularly

Add case study pipeline to your team's weekly or monthly review:
- How many are in progress?
- Which are stuck?
- What's blocking publication?

If you're not reviewing the pipeline, it will stall.

## 9. Connection to other playbooks

- **Onboarding:** Identify the problem and baseline KPI early. You can't show improvement without a "before."
- **Regular cadence:** Track progress toward KPI in every meeting. Surface case study readiness when metrics improve.
- **Health scoring:** Strong health signals (high engagement, positive sentiment) indicate case study candidates.
- **Alerts:** Trigger a "Case Study Candidate" alert when success criteria are met (e.g., KPI improvement ≥ X%, NPS ≥ 8).

## Final thought

Case studies are earned, not requested. Build the success first, then tell the story.

But don't rely on memory to capture them. Automate the trigger, track the pipeline, review the progress. Otherwise, your best stories never get told.
